### 🛠️ What I like to build
**🚀 Data & Curiosity**  
From analyzing F1 races in Python to exploring patterns in everyday systems — anything that helps understand how things really work.  

**⚡ Smart Tech**  
Automation, tools, and systems that make life smoother, faster, and more efficient — tech that feels alive.

### ⚡ Fun facts
- 🏎️ Big **Formula 1** fan — strategy, data, and tiny details that change everything.  
- ☕ Coffee, gym sessions, and side projects keep me going.  
- 🌍 I love discovering new places and could totally see myself living in different cities as a digital nomad someday.
